Algorithms Included

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Notebook: knn_from_scratch.ipynb
Description:
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is implemented from scratch, without using any external libraries like scikit-learn.
This notebook walks through the entire process, from loading the dataset to evaluating the model's performance.

2. Logistic Regression (LR)
Notebook: lr_from_scratch.ipynb
Description:
Logistic Regression is a fundamental algorithm for binary classification tasks.
The implementation covers the mathematical foundations, gradient descent optimization, and performance evaluation.
Prerequisites

To run the notebooks, you'll need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib

Usage

Each notebook is self-contained and provides detailed explanations of the algorithm, along with code implementation and examples. You can run the cells sequentially to see how the algorithm is built from scratch and tested on sample datasets.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve an existing implementation, fix bugs, or add new algorithms, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
